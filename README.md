# BBB-videotransformer

A server tool for streaming Bilibili videos on BlackBerry 9900 and other BlackBerry OS7 devices. (You can use Android's Termux or other Linux distributions, but currently only the Android Termux version is available.) Support for other modern video platforms including YouTube and Tiktok may be added in the future.

Small note: Of the three "B"s in the name, the first two stand for BlackBerry, and the third one stands for Bilibili.
