# BBB-videotransformer

A server tool for streaming Bilibili videos on BlackBerry 9900 and other BlackBerry OS7 devices. (You can use Android's Termux or other Linux distributions, but currently only the Android Termux version is available.) Support for other modern video platforms including YouTube and Tiktok may be added in the future.

Note: Don't ask why the project name is different from the project name under the project. The reason is that I hastily named the library. Later, I wanted to change it, but I was too lazy, so I gave up.
