# BBB-videotransformer

A server tool for playing Bilibili videos online on BlackBerry 9900 and other BlackBerry OS7 devices using HTTP media streaming. (You can use Termux for Android or other Linux distributions, but currently only the Android version of Termux is available.)

No need to download videos to your BlackBerry, you can just play videos directly on your BlackBerry 9900 device without taking up too much storage space.Just like Bilibili on other platforms, you can watch online videos.

Technically, HTTP media streaming is used to push media to BlackBerry for playback.




Small note: Of the three "B"s in the name, the first two stand for BlackBerry, and the third one stands for Bilibili.
